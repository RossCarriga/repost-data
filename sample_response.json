I really don&amp;#39;t know what to do except continue working on my own apps in the hopes of making it big or waste my time with employer tests where they don&amp;#39;t even bother to say what the interview topics are beforehand (testing, profiling, leetcode, java basics, UI framework, standard Android interview questions found online, non-standard Android interview questions, web, etc.). You would think I would be expert at interview by now but every interviewer seems to ask different questions these days so it&amp;#39;s impossible to prepare for. I understand it is probably a problem of supply and demand but it is true that I don&amp;#39;t get all of the interview questions right of course since they are so random these days. I&amp;#39;ve done about 100-150 interviews including recruiter chats with no offers. I&amp;#39;ve had about 10 or so onsites. If anyone is in the Bay Area who is hiring for Android Developer now, send me message please.

I reached out to a BA at that company that I'm still friends with to ask him if their actively hiring for that role, and before he responded to me he ran it by one of the hiring managers for that position. He said the mgr seemed excited and now wants me to reach out to him via email. \n\nA few questions:\n\n- Will my QA experience help, or hurt my chances of landing this role? \n\n- Assuming all other things are equal (company stability, benefits), would a lateral move in terms of base salary be worth it? What about a slight pay cut?\n\n- Should I worry about issues with my previous consulting company/coworkers that are still in that office?\n\n- Anything else I should keep in mind for making this move?",
