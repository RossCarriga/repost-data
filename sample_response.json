I applied for a company a while ago , they sent me a project to work on within a week , I did that and after two weeks they send me back for an interview with two developers . The position was for a JS developer , and that&amp;#39;s not really my background but I&amp;#39;m good enough at it that I wanted to try , I did the project which took some time , but I though that&amp;#39;s a better representation of my skills than some questions , I invested in it a lot of time to provide something respectful . The interviewers were some of the rudest and most condescending people I&amp;#39;ve ever dealt with . They ask questions and look away , they&amp;#39;re not even looking at me , they have no reaction to anything I say , they&amp;#39;re like two robots that would not engage you in anything other than the questions they have . They started by normal technical questions , I answered them all , then they tried to go deeper and I held my own until I really couldn&amp;#39;t , I got nervous and English isn&amp;#39;t my first language so every time I answer they ask about my answer just to embarrass me , until I started answering with I don&amp;#39;t know , like they were getting a kick out of it , all there comments and answers were condescending comments on my answers , they were far experienced than me and not interested at all , then why waste my time . The position was for a 2 year experience which I was but they&amp;#39;re asking about stuff higher than my qualifications in all sorts of stuff and being really mean , and one of these cunts was asking immediately and looking away and yawning and some absolutely disrespectful shit . Then when they&amp;#39;ve had enough fun they told me &amp;quot; we&amp;#39;ll get back to you next week &amp;quot; , then laughed and said &amp;quot; well maybe this week &amp;quot; . &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;#39;t my first experience with this , this happened to me 3 or 4 times during the last period looking for a job . And I&amp;#39;m absolutely  fed up with these fuckin people and these arrogant developers , I have 4 years of experience overall , I&amp;#39;m not the best developer in the world but I can do a good job and expect nothing from people in the industry but some respect . I can only imagine how it might be like for a fresh graduate dealing with people like that and how it effects their confidence , because it has certainly hurt mine , but now I&amp;#39;m just ANGRY , angry as can be . It&amp;#39;s been a week and I still think about sending these guys a letter telling them to go fuck themselves , ohhh  they sent me an email the next day telling me thank you for your energy and effort but you&amp;#39;re not a match . &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I honestly hate the industry so much right now from dealing with people like these , in the job and looking for a job . I&amp;#39;m seriously considering selling some shit or doing something else , because most of my experiences have been with pricks like these , even when you&amp;#39;re asking a question on some forum for answers someone comes over and condenses what your asking . Fuck this shit !&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sorry I&amp;#39;m ranting but I had to let it out , because I was gonna explode , I know maybe what I&amp;#39;m writing doesn&amp;#39;t make sense because I&amp;#39;m angry right now so take it as that .

                         "selftext": "I'm fuming right now as this has been happening to me for a while now . I applied for a company a while ago , they sent me a project to work on within a week , I did that and after two weeks they send me back for an interview with two developers . The position was for a JS developer , and that's not really my background but I'm good enough at it that I wanted to try , I did the project which took some time , but I though that's a better representation of my skills than some questions , I invested in it a lot of time to provide something respectful . The interviewers were some of the rudest and most condescending people I've ever dealt with . They ask questions and look away , they're not even looking at me , they have no reaction to anything I say , they're like two robots that would not engage you in anything other than the questions they have . They started by normal technical questions , I answered them all , then they tried to go deeper and I held my own until I really couldn't , I got nervous and English isn't my first language so every time I answer they ask about my answer just to embarrass me , until I started answering with I don't know , like they were getting a kick out of it , all there comments and answers were condescending comments on my answers , they were far experienced than me and not interested at all , then why waste my time . The position was for a 2 year experience which I was but they're asking about stuff higher than my qualifications in all sorts of stuff and being really mean , and one of these cunts was asking immediately and looking away and yawning and some absolutely disrespectful shit . Then when they've had enough fun they told me \" we'll get back to you next week \" , then laughed and said \" well maybe this week \" . \n\nThis isn't my first experience with this , this happened to me 3 or 4 times during the last period looking for a job . And I'm absolutely  fed up with these fuckin people and these arrogant developers , I have 4 years of experience overall , I'm not the best developer in the world but I can do a good job and expect nothing from people in the industry but some respect . I can only imagine how it might be like for a fresh graduate dealing with people like that and how it effects their confidence , because it has certainly hurt mine , but now I'm just ANGRY , angry as can be . It's been a week and I still think about sending these guys a letter telling them to go fuck themselves , ohhh  they sent me an email the next day telling me thank you for your energy and effort but you're not a match . \n\nI honestly hate the industry so much right now from dealing with people like these , in the job and looking for a job . I'm seriously considering selling some shit or doing something else , because most of my experiences have been with pricks like these , even when you're asking a question on some forum for answers someone comes over and condenses what your asking . Fuck this shit !\n\nI'm sorry I'm ranting but I had to let it out , because I was gonna explode , I know maybe what I'm writing doesn't make sense because I'm angry right now so take it as that .
